                  Felt is a non-woven cloth that is produced by matting, condensing and pressing wool. Some types of felt are very soft,
                  but some are tough enough to form construction materials. Felt can be of any color, and made into any shape or size.
                  When cooled, dried and compressed, the scales close and lock the wool into the tough, durable material we call felt. From Nepal 
                  we manufacture and export Felts product so innned contact us.
